UFOcore Library
=======

A pure and powerful JavaScript Bitcoin library.

## Principles

UFO is a powerful new peer-to-peer platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the UFO network allows for highly resilient ufo infrastructure, and the developer community needs reliable, open-source tools to implement ufo apps and services.

## Get Started

```
npm install ufocore-lib
```

```
bower install ufocore-lib
```

## Documentation

The complete docs are hosted here: [bitcore documentation](http://bitcore.io/guide/). There's also a [bitcore API reference](http://bitcore.io/api/) available generated from the JSDocs of the project, where you'll find low-level details on each ufocore utility.
